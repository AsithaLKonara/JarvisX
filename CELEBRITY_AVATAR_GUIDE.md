## üîß **INTEGRATION GUIDE**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Model**

```bash
# Check model requirements:
‚úì Format: GLB or GLTF
‚úì Has bones/skeleton
‚úì Has facial blend shapes (morph targets)
‚úì File size: Under 50MB
‚úì Textures: Embedded in GLB

# If FBX or other format:
# Use Blender to convert (see Method 2 above)
```

### **Step 2: Place Model in Project**

```bash
cd /Users/asithalakmal/Documents/web/JarvisX

# Create avatars directory:
mkdir -p apps/desktop/public/models/avatars

# Copy your model:
cp ~/Downloads/megan-fox-avatar.glb apps/desktop/public/models/avatars/

# Now accessible at: /models/avatars/megan-fox-avatar.glb
```

### **Step 3: Add to Avatar Presets**

```typescript
// Edit: apps/desktop/src/components/avatar/AvatarSelector.tsx

export const AVATAR_PRESETS: AvatarPreset[] = [
  // ... existing presets ...
  
  // Add your celebrity avatar:
  {
    id: 'celebrity-megan',
    name: 'Megan (Celebrity Style)',
    description: 'Hollywood glamour - Megan Fox inspired',
    modelUrl: '/models/avatars/megan-fox-avatar.glb',
    thumbnail: '/models/avatars/megan-fox-avatar.jpg', // Add thumbnail too!
    category: 'celebrity',
    tags: ['female', 'glamorous', 'hollywood', 'brunette'],
  },
];
```

### **Step 4: Test Your Avatar**

```bash
# Start the desktop app:
cd /Users/asithalakmal/Documents/web/JarvisX/apps/desktop
npm run dev

# Or use the standalone demo:
# Edit: apps/desktop/joi-avatar-demo.html
# Change modelUrl to: '/models/avatars/megan-fox-avatar.glb'
```

### **Step 5: Verify Blend Shapes**

```typescript
// The avatar renderer will automatically detect blend shapes
// Check console for: "üé≠ Avatar morph targets found: X"

// If you see 0 morph targets, your model might not have blend shapes
// You'll need to add them in Blender or use a different model
```
